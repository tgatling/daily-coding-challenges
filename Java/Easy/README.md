## Resources

- [Java ArrayList Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html)
- [Java Streams API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html)

## Notes

- 2024-07-31: The Second Maximum Number problem solution uses a single-pass algorithm, which is efficient for large datasets. However, there might be room for improvement in terms of code clarity and edge case handling.
- For future problems, consider exploring Java 8+ features like streams and lambda expressions for more concise and expressive code.
