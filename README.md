# Daily Coding Challenges

This repository documents my journey through daily coding challenges. Each day, I tackle new problems to enhance my programming skills, improve my problem-solving abilities, and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Tequesha McKinnon. I'm passionate about coding and constantly striving to improve my skills. This challenge is my way of enhancing my problem-solving abilities and deepening my understanding of algorithms and data structures. Through consistent practice and learning, I aim to become a more proficient and versatile developer.

## Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills
- Enhance understanding of data structures and algorithms
- Build a consistent coding habit
- Solve at least 5 problems per week (Monday-Friday at a minimum)
- Implement solutions in multiple languages
- Focus on optimizing solutions for time and space complexity

Each language directory contains subdirectories for different difficulty levels, and each problem solution is in its own file.

## Structure of Solutions

- Challenges are organized by date
- Each solution includes the problem statement and my approach
- Comments in the code explain the thought process
