# Daily Coding Challenges

This repository documents my journey through daily coding challenges. Each day, I tackle new problems to enhance my programming skills, improve my problem-solving abilities, and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills
- Enhance understanding of data structures and algorithms
- Build a consistent coding habit

## Structure

- Challenges are organized by date
- Each solution includes the problem statement and my approach
- Comments in the code explain the thought process
